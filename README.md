ACM-Problems
============

This repository consists of all the problems I've solved (or am in the process of solving) from the UVa website.
These are practice problems for the annual ACM competition.

This repsository is an ongoing endeavor since I've always had, and always will have, a passionate curiosity for algorithmic techniques and a penchant for novel perspectives. 

Thus, so as long as there are problems to solve, this repository will continue being updated!
