ACM-Problems
============

This repository consists of all the problems I've solved (or am in the process of solving) from the UVa website.
These are practice problems for the annual ACM competition.

This repsository is an ongoing endeavor since I've always had a passionate curiosity for algorithmic techniques
and a burning desire for new perspectives (which can be gained from doing such non-trivial problems). 

Thus, as long as there are questions to solve, this repository will continue being updated!
