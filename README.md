# ACM-Problems

This repository consists of all the problems I've solved (or am in the process of solving) from the [UVa website](http://uva.onlinejudge.org/).
Started off as practice problems for the annual ACM competition.
Now, it is an ongoing endeavor that fulfills a penchant for problem solving.
