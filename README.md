ACM-Problems
============

This repository consists of all the problems I've solved (or am in the process of solving) from the UVa website.
Started off as practice problems for the annual ACM competition.
Now, it is an ongoing endeavor that fulfills my thirst for new algorithmic techniques and satisfies a penchant for novel perspectives.
